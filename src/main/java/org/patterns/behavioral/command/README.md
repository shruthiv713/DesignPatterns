# Command Pattern

 The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.  
 It decouples the sender of a request from the receiver, allowing for more flexible and extensible code.
 
For example, in a GUI application, a button click can be encapsulated as a command object that can be executed, undone, or queued for later execution.
