The Observer pattern defines a one-to-may dependency between objects, so that when one object changes, all of its
dependents are notified and updated.
 It is used to achieve loose coupling between the Subject and the Observers, or Publisher and Subscribers.
  (2 objects interact having very little knowledge of each other)
New Observers can be added to the Subject without modifying it.
Subjects only need to know minimal information about the Observer.
Changes to either Subject or Observers will not affect each other.
