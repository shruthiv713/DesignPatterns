Creational Patterns, focus on object creation mechanisms.
- The primary goal is to abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed and respresented.
- In simpler terms, creational patterns deal with the "how" of creating objects.
- Instead of directly instantiating objects using the new operator, these patterns provide various ways to create objects more flexibly and robustly.
