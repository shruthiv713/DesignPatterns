Structural Patterns, describe how objects are connected to each other.
They relate to the principles of decomposition (HAS-A) and generalization (IS-A)
- How classes and objects are composed and organized to form larger structures.
- Does this class contain another class (composition), or is a parent of another? (inheritance)
- Think of them as blueprints for arranging building blocks (classes and objects) in a way that creates robust and adaptable architectures.
